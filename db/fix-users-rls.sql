DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON public.users;

-- Recreate policies with INSERT permission
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" ON public.users
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile" ON public.users
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
